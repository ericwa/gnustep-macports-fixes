description A back-end component for the GNUstep GUI Library.
long_description \
    The implementation of the GNUstep GUI Library is designed \
    in two parts.  The first part is the front-end component \
    which is independent of platform and display system.  \
    This front-end is combined with a back-end component \
    which handles all of the display system dependent \
    such as specific calls to the X Window System.
