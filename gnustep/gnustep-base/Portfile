description         A library of general-purpose Objective C objects.
long_description \
    The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, \
    non-graphical Objective C objects. For example, it includes classes \
    for strings, object collections, byte streams, typed coders, \
    invocations, notifications, notification dispatchers, \
    moments in time, network ports, remote object messaging support \
    (distributed objects), and event loops. \
    \
    It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical \
    portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).
