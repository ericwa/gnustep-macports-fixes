long_description \
    The GNUstep gui library is a library of graphical user interface \
    classes written completely in the Objective-C language. \
    The classes are based upon the OpenStep specification as released by \
    NeXT Software, Inc. These classes include graphical objects such as \
    buttons, text fields, popup lists, browser lists, and windows. \
    There are also many associated classes for handling events, colors, \
    fonts, pasteboards and images.
