description     GNUstep makefile package
long_description \
    The GNUstep makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to \
    write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to \
    write a project without having to deal with the complex issues \
    associated with configuration, building, installation, and packaging. \
    It also allows the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.
